            Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator
         When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.
      
      You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.
      
            
            - What was your motivation?
            This project is an amazing opportunity to develop a deep knowdledge about Nodejs, how to use inquirer and require package, beside that, this project allows to the students to put in practice in real time project, all this tools together in order to get genearate a README file.
            - Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
            I built this project because it will allow me to learn to generate a README file. The README file is very important for any project on Github, because it's the best way to let the users to understand our projects with all the important details.
            - What problem does it solve?
            The problems I faced meanwhile I was developing this project was to understand the way require and inquirer work. Also, It was a little difficult for me to find the best way to generate a README file because I was getting some extra characters in the generated file and it was difficult to read it.
            - What did you learn?
            I learned to combine require and inquirer. How important and useful is inquirer package in order to get information from the user and also, how useful is the require package in order to read and create files.

            To add a screenshot, create an (image directory) folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
            
                md
                ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
